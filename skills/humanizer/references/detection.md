# Detection Guidance

Consult this before rewriting so you don't gut legitimate human prose. A clean human writer can hit many of the catalog patterns without any AI involvement. When in doubt, look for **clusters** of tells, not isolated ones.

## What NOT to flag (false positives)

A clean human writer can hit several of the patterns in `references/patterns.md` without any AI involvement. Before rewriting, sanity-check that you are not gutting legitimate prose. The following are *not* reliable indicators on their own:

- **Perfect grammar and consistent style.** Many writers are professionals or have been edited. Polish does not equal AI.
- **Mixed casual and formal registers.** This often signals a person in a technical field, a young writer, or someone with neurodivergent prose habits, not a chatbot.
- **"Bland" or "robotic" prose.** AI prose has *specific* tells. Generic dryness without those tells is just dry writing.
- **Formal or academic vocabulary.** AI overuses *specific* fancy words (see §7 in `references/patterns.md`), not all fancy words. Don't flatten "ostensibly" or "constituent" just because they sound brainy.
- **Letter-style opening or closing on a comment.** Salutations and sign-offs predate ChatGPT by centuries.
- **Common transition words in isolation.** *Additionally*, *moreover*, *consequently* are AI-coded only when piled up. One *however* is not a tell.
- **Curly quotes alone.** macOS, Word, Google Docs, and most CMSes auto-curl by default. Curly quotes only count when stacked with other tells.
- **Em dashes alone.** Many editors and journalists use them often. Em dashes are evidence only when paired with formulaic sales-y rhythm. (This is about judging the source. The rewrite still removes them per §14.)
- **One short emphatic sentence.** Humans use clipped sentences to land a point. Flag staccato drama only when several short fragments appear in a row and inflate the tone.
- **"Honestly" or "look" mid-sentence.** These are ordinary in casual writing. The tell is the standalone theatrical opener, not the word itself.
- **Unsourced claims.** Most of the web is unsourced. Lack of citations doesn't prove anything.
- **Correct, complex formatting.** Visual editors and templates produce clean output without any AI.
- **Secondhand text.** Do not rewrite watched phrases inside quotations, titles, proper names, or examples where the phrase is being discussed rather than used.
- **Persuasive tone in marketing copy.** Blog posts and landing pages are supposed to sell. Benefit claims, a confident headline, a direct CTA, and scannable bold or bullets are the format, not AI tells. Flag only the *generic, unearned* version of each.
- **Title-case headings under a brand style guide.** AP-style title case is a house-style choice in marketing, not a chatbot fingerprint.
- **Real social proof.** Named customers, real logos, and specific numbers are conversion assets. Only vague or unverifiable proof ("trusted by leading brands") is a tell.
- **Keywords and heading structure.** A repeated target keyword and an H2/H3 outline are SEO requirements, not repetition or padding to smooth away. Don't paraphrase the primary keyword out of the title, the first paragraph, or the headings.

When in doubt, look for **clusters** of tells, not isolated ones. A single em dash means nothing; em dashes plus rule-of-three plus *vibrant tapestry* plus a "Conclusion" section is a confession.

## Signs of human writing (preserve these)

When you see these, lean toward leaving the prose alone. They are evidence of a real person writing, and over-editing will destroy what makes the piece sound human:

- **Specific, unusual, hard-to-fabricate detail.** A real address. A weird quote. The phrase "the lawyer who used to work upstairs from my dentist." LLMs round off specifics; humans hoard them.
- **Mixed feelings and unresolved tension.** "I think this is mostly good, but it bothers me, and I can't fully explain why." LLMs default to clean takes.
- **Dated, era-bound references.** Slang, memes, or in-jokes that map to a specific year and subculture. Models lag by a year or more.
- **First-person editorial choices the writer can defend.** If the writer can explain *why* they made a particular cut or used a particular word, that's a strong human signal.
- **Variety in sentence length.** Measure it with the Mechanical Scan in `references/surfaces-and-scan.md`. Real writing alternates short and long. AI writing tends toward an even, mid-length cadence.
- **Genuine asides, parentheticals, or self-corrections.** "(I keep wanting to say 'almost' here, but it really was certain.)" Models rarely interrupt themselves like this.
- **Edits made before November 30, 2022.** ChatGPT's public launch. Anything older than that is, with very rare exceptions, not AI-written.
